        <h4>question: what is your favorite thing about wainestock?
        </h4>
        <div class="quote">"It’s outside, beautiful and welcomes community and encourages/supports the arts far and wide"</div>
<div class="quote">"The warm community gathering"</div>
<div class="quote">"Really amazing local music in the park, gathering of community"</div>

<h4>how do you think grant funds could be best utilized to enhance the festival?</h4>

<div class="quote">"Paying the organizers, artist’s participation, to keep it accessible to the community"</div>
<div class="quote">"Currently Joe Waine pays for all food vendors, talent, and outdoor games out of pocket. It would be great to help him better financially support local talent and provide more activities for all ages to participate in. It would also be amazing to get more promotion so more community members can enjoy this amazing event!"</div>
<div class="quote">"It’s an amazing community event that happens each year. But it’s potentially not sustainable without funding by grants? The funds will help pay for the stage, sound crew and equipment, the performers, and any other extra surprises"</div>
<div class="quote">"Paying for PA equipment, staff and bands"</div>
<div class="quote">"More promotion/advertising for festival"</div>
<div class="quote">"Perhaps the funds could be used to help pay musicians to keep ticket costs low and the event accessible to all."</div>
<div class="quote">"More pay for artists is always a plus, perhaps more promotion budget as well"</div>
<div class="quote">"I think it would help Joe cover the cost of putting on such a great festival for the community."</div>
<div class="quote">"More money for the bands, amenities like food and drinks, additional staff, promotion"</div>
<div class="quote">"Paying Bands"</div>
<div class="quote">"security? (although i did not feel this has been needed). maybe sponsors?"</div>
<div class="quote">"Advertising and getting the word out"</div>
<div class="quote">"Pay for sound equipment and bands so it’s not a financial burden on the person putting it on"</div>
<div class="quote">"Provide funding for local performance, dance, and visual artists to enhance the festival feel and broaden the audience. I imagine some interactive activities could be really engaging and could happen throughout the day."</div>
<div class="quote">"For beefing up the stage production, marketing, even security for the performers instruments"</div>
<div class="quote">"more diversity in demographics of performers! more than half were white male indie bands :-/ to make it more of a true inclusive ‘community’ event i think diversity within performers would be important .. i think i counted 2 solo femme musicians and 1 trans musician this yr ? and maybe 3 people of color ? could do better !"</div>
<div class="quote">"Paying performers! It’s just important. Also more of the fun little side activities like the bubble wands and such, those are always fun when you need a break from sitting and watching, or something to do between sets."</div>
<div class="quote">"Paying performers and more hippie toys"</div>
<div class="quote">"Payment to artists would be awesome, also more advertising to let more folks know about this wonderful event"</div>
<div class="quote">"paying artists and promotion"</div>
<div class="quote">"Always great to pay the event for things like musical equipment and great sound systems. It does get dark so lights would be helpful. Obviously paying staff and bands would always be helpful but I hope that’s a given at this point."</div>
