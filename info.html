<h4>what makes wainestock unique?</h4>

<div class="quote">"<i>In these days with the city becoming so expensive it’s an insane effort to throw an event that takes so much work and organizing just for the good of the community. There are plenty of music festivals but all of them are built on a model of capitalizing off of attendees and its performers And this one supports community attendance far and wide no matter what income or accessibility bracket you may be at</i>" - jackie canchola</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>Wainestock is unique because it is comprised of a diverse group of local artists that are all participating for the love of music and their community. Everyone feels like a friend at Wainestock!! The yard games are inclusive to all. Everyone feels welcome.</i>" - lauren rodriguez, performer</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>Creative and outsider local artists coming together to create a beautiful community event</i>" - brooklynn castellanos, volunteer</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>It’s accessibility to the community. It is done out of passion for music and bringing people together, rather than being driven by money and business.</i>" - dena, performer and volunteer</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>It’s a DIY show but over the course of 3-days—pretty impressive feat!</i>" - robert borrego, performer and volunteer</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>The handmade, crafted nature of all the artwork and set/state design, and the glue that holds it all together, Joe Waine!</i>" - teri rakusin, attendee</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>It's hosted in a beautiful city park but still feels so DIY and community-driven—because it is!</i>" - brennen, attendee</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>The collection of different people and music all coming together and hanging in the park.</i>" - nate hoe, attendee</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>It’s a true DIY festival that stands out among the other prohibitively expensive, corporate, “cool” music festivals in town</i>" - kara, performer and volunteer</div>

<div class="quote">"<i>artists from all backgrounds, free, it feels hidden and is small!</i>" - jesse miller, performer and volunteer</div>

<div class="quote">"<i>The bubbles</i>" - rachel, attendee</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>location/accessibility</i>" - greg, attendee</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>It’s feels really intimate. Just some local small bands, a lot of the bands/attendees know each other. It feels small and special and homey.</i>" - onna, attendee</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>Joseph waine of course he is a truly unique soul</i>" - liz, attendee</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>It feels like a tight knit community but also so welcoming and warm.</i>" - ziam downey, performer</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>that it's fully donation based and artist run</i>" - cam hancock, performer</div>

<h4>how do you think grant funds could be best utilized to enhance the festival?</h4>


<div class="quote">"<i>Paying the organizers, artist’s participation, to keep it accessible to the community</i>" - jackie canchola</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>Currently Joe Waine pays for all food vendors, talent, and outdoor games out of pocket. It would be great to help him better financially support local talent and provide more activities for all ages to participate in. It would also be amazing to get more promotion so more community members can enjoy this amazing event!</i>" - lauren rodriguez, performer</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>It’s an amazing community event that happens each year. But it’s potentially not sustainable without funding by grants? The funds will help pay for the stage, sound crew and equipment, the performers, and any other extra surprises</i>" - brooklynn castellanos, volunteer</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>Paying for PA equipment, staff and bands</i>" - dena, performer and volunteer</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>More promotion/advertising for festival</i>" - robert borrego, performer and volunteer</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>Perhaps the funds could be used to help pay musicians to keep ticket costs low and the event accessible to all.</i>" - teri rakusin, attendee</div>

<div class="quote">"<i>I think it would help Joe cover the cost of putting on such a great festival for the community.</i>" - nate hoe, attendee</div>

<div class="quote">"<i>Paying Bands</i>" - koji, volunteer</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>security? (although i did not feel this has been needed). maybe sponsors?</i>" - jesse miller, performer and volunteer</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>Advertising and getting the word out</i>" - tom moskal, attendee</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>Pay for sound equipment and bands so it’s not a financial burden on the person putting it on</i>" - leah, attendee</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>Provide funding for local performance, dance, and visual artists to enhance the festival feel and broaden the audience. I imagine some interactive activities could be really engaging and could happen throughout the day.</i>" - ryan mortensen, performer and volunteer</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>For beefing up the stage production, marketing, even security for the performers instruments</i>" - rachel, attendee</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>more diversity in demographics of performers! to make it more of a true inclusive ‘community’ event i think continuing to promote diversity within performers would be important.</i>" - greg, attendee</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>Paying performers! It’s just important. Also more of the fun little side activities like the bubble wands and such, those are always fun when you need a break from sitting and watching, or something to do between sets.</i>" - onna, attendee</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>Paying performers and more hippie toys</i>" - liz, attendee</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>Payment to artists would be awesome, also more advertising to let more folks know about this wonderful event</i>" - ziam downey, performer</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>paying artists and promotion</i>" - cam hancock, performer</div>
<div class="quote">"<i>Always great to pay the event for things like musical equipment and great sound systems. It does get dark so lights would be helpful. Obviously paying staff and bands would always be helpful but I hope that’s a given at this point.</i>" - erin, volunteer and attendee</div>
